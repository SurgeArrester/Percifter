Started work on making the GUI, done small program which lists a dir and displays files 
ISSUES - Can not open folders via filepicker, program appends to end of display and doesn't clear screen, maybe add some event handlers 
NEXT WORK - Gop through list of cif files and launch PersistenceGenerator.py on these and display the output to the screen
